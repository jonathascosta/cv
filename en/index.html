            <h3>About Me</h3>

            <p>I started dabbling in software development at the age of fifteen and instantly knew this was my calling.
                Fast forward to today, and that initial passion for algorithms and task automation hasn't waned—it's
                grown stronger.</p>

            <p> I've had the chance to be both a developer and an architect, always striving for innovation. My
                experiences range from coding in cafés to collaborating with international clients. I've worked across
                different time zones to meet client needs.</p>

            <p> I'm a fan of Design Patterns, but it's not just a buzzword to me—it's a lifelong learning commitment.
                Along the way, I've picked up invaluable lessons from each work experience, each project, and even those
                coding practices that made me scratch my head.</p>

            <p> My aim is simple: to share my years of experience and elevate the skills of those I work with. As for
                growing up, that's optional. What isn't optional is my ongoing quest for knowledge and improvement in
                the tech world.</p>

                <p>The graph below illustrates my experience with various technologies, represented by the length of
                    each bar. A longer bar indicates a longer period of time spent working with that particular
                    technology. <b>It's important to note that shorter bars don't necessarily imply less expertise, just
                        a
                        shorter duration of professional use.</b></p>

                <p>This graph is dynamically generated based on the technologies I've used across different work
                    experiences. It provides a quantitative view of my skill set, capturing not just what I know but
                    also how extensively I've worked with each technology.</p>
